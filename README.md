# gochiso
A set of scripts that tries to find article availability online.

## Setup outline
At a minimum, you probably want to copy `includes/config_default.inc` to `includes/config.inc` and set up the configuration values you find there.

Then point a script at `discovery.php`, `oadoi.php` and/or `openaccessbutton.php` with OpenURL parameters describing the resource you want to look up.
